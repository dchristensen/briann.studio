# About Ms. BriAnn

Hello! I’d love to get to know you! Here’s a little about me. I am a native of Utah. I graduated as a Red Devil 
from Springville High School and later with a degree in Music Education from Southern Utah University. After 
college and missionary service for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I taught choir and musical 
theater at Centennial Middle School in Provo.

In 2008 I married my husband, Derek and we quickly became parents to 4 active boys. In 2015, right after my 
fourth son was born, I started teaching the Suzuki Piano Method from home. Since then I have taught many students 
ages 2-50 and continually strive to improve my teaching skills. I am registered at all 7 levels of the Suzuki Piano 
repertoire with the Suzuki Association of the Americas receiving valuable instruction from Teacher Trainer and Suzuki 
Piano Pioneer Cleo Brimhall. I have traveled to other places for Suzuki Training including to Colorado for Suzuki 
Pedagogy in Action class and a week in Sacramento, California to learn from two teachers from the Talent Education 
Research Institute in Matsumoto, Japan. I have also completed the Suzuki Practicum and Teaching Strategies courses. 
I am currently working towards becoming a Piano Teacher Trainer in the SAA and hope to be able to complete that in 
the next few years. I am an active member of the The Suzuki Association of Utah and currently serve as the President 
of the board. I also am an active member of The Suzuki Association of the Americas, Utah Music Teachers Association 
and the National Federation of Music Clubs.

Besides music, I also love diet Dr. Pepper, reading, eating out, playing board games and traveling with my family. 
Next to spending time with my family, my greatest passion is teaching. I love seeing children progress and 
interacting one-on-one with them and their parents. I treasure all of the relationships I have made through Suzuki 
Piano. I subscribe to the whole philosophy of Dr. Shinichi Suzuki, but especially love this sentiment:

> Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If children hear fine music from the day of
> their birth and learn to play it, they develop sensitivity, discipline and endurance. They get a beautiful heart.

Above all else, music education is education of character.
